      <p>Support Black Creatives is a website dedicated to highlighting black creatives in every industry.  This is your one stop show to learn more about black creatives, and how to get in touch with them. After being inspired by Beyonceâ€™s Black Parade, I  wanted to create a website that uplifts black creatives. As well as a place to find creatives of all skill levels and disciplines, that also encourages diversifying the creative industry. </p>
