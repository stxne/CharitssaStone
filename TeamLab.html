    <div class="description">
      <p>As a part of a semester long project for my design studio course, we had to rebrand a city of our choice (you can view the city rebrand in Tokyo City) and pick a venue in that city and rebrand it and create a campaign in that venue.</p>
      <p>Since my city was Tokyo, Japan I chose to rebrand the Mori Building Digital Art Museum: Team Lab Borderless. TeamLabs is an art collective with museums and installations all around the world. They collaborated with Mori Building an urban Developer Based in tokyo to create the Mori Building Digital Art Museum: TeamLab Borderless, which is described as a “group of artworks that form one borderless world”.</p>
